# Feature Specification: Simple Web TODO App

**Feature Branch**: `001-web-todo`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "webgH‹·ó×ëjTODO¢×ê’\cf{WD"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ User wants a simple TODO app that works on the web
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: end users
   ’ Actions: manage TODO items
   ’ Data: TODO tasks/items
   ’ Constraints: simple, web-based
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User authentication required?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data persistence requirements?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-user support or single user?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User can create, view, edit, delete TODO items
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Basic CRUD operations for TODO items
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ TODO item entity
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding auth and persistence"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the web application to manage their personal tasks. They can add new TODO items, mark items as complete or incomplete, edit existing items, and remove items they no longer need. The interface should be simple and intuitive for quick task management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the TODO app homepage, **When** they enter a task description and click "Add", **Then** the new TODO item appears in the list
2. **Given** the user has TODO items in their list, **When** they click on a TODO item's checkbox, **Then** the item toggles between complete and incomplete states
3. **Given** the user has a TODO item in their list, **When** they click an edit button/action, **Then** they can modify the task description
4. **Given** the user has TODO items in their list, **When** they click a delete button/action, **Then** the item is removed from the list
5. **Given** the user has both complete and incomplete items, **When** they view their list, **Then** they can distinguish between completed and pending tasks

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user tries to add an empty TODO item?
- How does the system handle very long task descriptions?
- What happens if the user accidentally deletes an item?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new TODO items with text descriptions
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all TODO items in a readable list format
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to mark TODO items as complete or incomplete
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to edit existing TODO item descriptions
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete TODO items from their list
- **FR-006**: System MUST visually distinguish between completed and incomplete TODO items
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent creation of empty TODO items
- **FR-008**: System MUST be accessible via web browser
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: persist TODO items between sessions or session-only?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: support multiple users or single user only?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: require user authentication or anonymous access?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TODO Item**: Represents a single task with description text, completion status (complete/incomplete), and creation timestamp
